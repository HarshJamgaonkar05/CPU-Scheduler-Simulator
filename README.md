# CPU Scheduling Simulator ðŸ–¥

An interactive and visual Python-based simulator for understanding and comparing classic CPU scheduling algorithms such as **FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority**, and **Round Robin**. Designed with a modern dark-themed GUI using **Tkinter** and integrated **Gantt chart** visualizations via **Matplotlib**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project simulates the execution of processes under different CPU scheduling strategies. It aims to enhance conceptual understanding by allowing users to dynamically generate processes, run simulations, and visualize the output with calculated metrics and timelines.

## âœ¨ Features

-  Supports **5 Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin (with user-defined time quantum)

-  **Customizable Process Count**: Users can choose how many processes to simulate (1â€“20).

-  **Round Robin Quantum Input**: Time quantum control for Round Robin.

-  **Live Gantt Chart Visualization**: Timeline chart generated for each simulation.

-  **Detailed Results Table**:
  - Start Time
  - Completion Time
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time

-  **GUI** built using **Tkinter**.
